# Helios - Core

*Scala library of shared utilities*


## Introduction

**Helios-Core** is a general-purpose Scala library belonging to the multifaceted [Helios](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Helios/206962992779275) project.


Helios-core focuses on different areas:

* *application versioning*

* *file-system*, *desktop integration* and *OS information* utilities

* *general-purpose functions*


Other libraries of the project cover specific domains - for example:

* ScalaFX utilities are provided by [Helios-fx](https://github.com/giancosta86/Helios-fx)

* JPA extensions are in [Helios-jpa](https://github.com/giancosta86/Helios-jpa)

* Reflection utilities are provided by [Helios-reflection](https://github.com/giancosta86/Helios-reflection)


As an important point, Helios is designed to be compatible with [Aurora](https://github.com/giancosta86/Aurora), making it very easy to employ the artifacts created by Aurora.

Helios is meant to evolve over time - please refer to its Scaladoc or its source code for more details on its current packages.
