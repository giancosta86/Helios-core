# Helios - Core

*Scala library of shared utilities*


## Introduction

**Helios - Core** is a general-purpose Scala / ScalaFX library belonging to the multifaceted [Helios](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Helios/206962992779275) project, as well as an [OSGi](https://www.osgi.org/) bundle.


The first version of Helios dates back to 2013 and was written in Java; Helios 2 now mainly targets Scala and ScalaFX.

Its main areas are:

* *application versioning* - especially via its support for [Aurora](https://github.com/giancosta86/Aurora)

* *JavaFX / ScalaFX extensions*

* *file-system*, *desktop integration* and *OS information* utilities

* *general-purpose functions*


Helios is meant to evolve over time - please refer to its Scaladoc or its source code for more details on its current packages.
