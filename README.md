# Helios - Core

*Scala library of shared utilities*


## Introduction

**Helios-Core** is a general-purpose Scala / ScalaFX library belonging to the multifaceted [Helios](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Helios/206962992779275) project.

The first version of Helios dates back to 2013 and was written in Java; Helios 2 is now mainly based on Scala and ScalaFX.


Helios-core focuses on different areas:

* *application versioning and startup*

* *JavaFX / ScalaFX extensions*

* *file-system*, *desktop integration* and *OS information* utilities

* *general-purpose functions*


As an important point, Helios-core 2 is designed to be compatible with [Aurora](https://github.com/giancosta86/Aurora), making it very easy to employ the artifacts created by Aurora.

Helios is meant to evolve over time - please refer to its Scaladoc or its source code for more details on its current packages.
