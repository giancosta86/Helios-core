/**
 * An event, keeping track of its listeners.
 * <p>
 * This means that, in your Java beans, you just have to declare an event as a
 * private field whose type is a subclass of Event, and your addXXXListener()
 * and removeXXXListener() should just call its addListener() and
 * removeListener() methods. Similarly, to notify the listeners, you don't need
 * to manually iterate over a collection of listeners, but you should call the
 * fire(...) method of your event class (every event class has specific
 * parameters for the fire() methods).
 * <p>
 * This class can be serialized, but the list of its listeners is, by design,
 * transient, and will be recreated when the event is deserialized.
